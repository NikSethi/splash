Noir is developed using and hosted with GitHub. You can head on over to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) to download it, report any bugs, and to request features.

If you prefer to install the gem version of the theme you can do so [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/noir-for-jekyll).

Here are all of the changes in this latest release:

#### CHANGELOG

<span class="fixed">FIXED</span> Liquid syntax warnings that would be displayed under certain circumstances when initiating a local running instance.

<span class="improved">IMPROVED</span> Per-category Atom feeds. A great way to separate topics or keep *linked-list*/microblog style posts out of a feed. There is an example
file called announcements.xml which can be changed in order to fit your needs.

This theme is a constant work in progress. If you have any issues, questions or suggestions please send them [my way](https://github.com/essentialenemy)...and thank you for your interest in Noir!
